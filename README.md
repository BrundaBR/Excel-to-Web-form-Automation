# Excel-to-Web-form-Automation

## problem
The recuring process of adding data/promotion captured in file to portal either stark or sharepoint is time consuming.<br>
Estimate:
Time consumed for this process is approximately 5 minutes per day and 25 minutes for a week, which is not particularly efficient.

## Solution offered
Solution i am proposing is to automate the process of manually adding data to portal such as sharepoint or stark.

End goal:
The  application will only require adding file to application and the data will automatically get stored in portal.


## Disadvantages

As there might be a chance of creating new file as the row count has reached 25000 then there will be need to update url as this system mails navigates and populates data on bases of url.<br>

The data stored in excel should be in particular format as the system decides populating data based on position of data.

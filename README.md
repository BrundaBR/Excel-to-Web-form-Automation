# Excel-to-Web-form-Automation

## problem
The recuring process of adding data/promotion captured in file to portal either stark or sharepoint is time consuming.<br>
time consumed for this process is approximately 5 minutes and 25 minutes for a week.

## Solution offered
The application will only require adding file which will be input and the data will automatically get stored in portal.

## Disadvantages

As there might be a chance of creating new file as the row count has reached 25000 then there will be need to update url as this system mails navigates and populates data on bases of url.

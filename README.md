# Excel-to-Web-form-Automation

## problem
The recuring process of adding data/promotion captured in file to portal either stark or sharepoint is time consuming.<br>
Estimate:
Time consumed for this process is approximately 5 minutes per day and 25 minutes for a week, which is not particularly efficient.

## Solution offered
Solution i am proposing is to automate the process of manually adding data to portal such as sharepoint or stark.

End goal:
The  application will only require adding file to application and the data will automatically get stored in portal.


## Disadvantages

1. When new file is created for a region, this application would fail as new url has to be updated in backend<br>

2. The data stored in excel should be in particular format as the system decides populating data based on position of data, this would be overcome by using supreeth's excel template.
